            A ruthless, disciplined approach to building wealth by stripping life down to what actually matters.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Iron Pot Millionaire is not about being cheap — it's about being surgical. You define the leanest,
              most focused version of your life — your "iron pot" baseline — and run that version long enough to
              radically change your financial trajectory.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
              This framework is built on the belief that most wealth problems are discipline problems, not income
              problems. By eliminating lifestyle noise and channeling maximum resources toward financial goals, you
              compress decades of progress into years.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-heading font-bold mb-4 text-white">How to Run It</h2>
            <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-lg text-gray-300 space-y-4">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Define your non-negotiables:</strong> Housing, food, basic transport,
                essential tools. Write them down. Be honest but ruthless.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Cut everything else for a defined season:</strong> Subscriptions,
                lifestyle fluff, status spending, entertainment excess. Set a timeline — 12 months, 24 months — and commit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Stack cash aggressively:</strong> Attack debt with intensity or build
                assets with laser focus. Every dollar has a job.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-white">Track progress weekly, not emotionally:</strong> Numbers only. No
                justifications. No excuses. Just data and execution.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
              Iron Pot Millionaire works because it removes complexity, kills excuses, and forces focus. It's not
              comfortable. It's not fun. But it works — and it works fast.
