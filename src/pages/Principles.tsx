              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Wealth is not built on motivation, impulse, or feelings. It's built on discipline — the ability to
                execute a plan consistently, regardless of external noise or internal resistance.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
                Emotional decisions destroy wealth. Disciplined systems build it. The difference between financial
                success and failure isn't intelligence or income — it's the ability to stick to the plan when it's boring,
                hard, or inconvenient.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-heading font-bold mb-4 text-white">Minimalism With Purpose</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Minimalism isn't about deprivation — it's about clarity. It's about cutting the noise, the clutter,
                and the complexity that keeps you from moving forward.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
                When you strip away everything that doesn't matter, what's left is what actually moves the needle.
                Fewer distractions. Fewer excuses. More focus. More progress. Minimalism gives you control.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Money doesn't grow by accident. It grows when it's directed by a deliberate, thoughtful plan.
                Strategy beats luck every time.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
                Building wealth requires architecture — systems for earning, saving, investing, and protecting.
                It requires scenario planning — knowing what to do when things go wrong. And it requires long-term
                thinking — playing the infinite game, not the short-term hustle.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-heading font-bold mb-4 text-white">Responsibility Over Excuses</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
                You are responsible for your financial life. Not the economy. Not your boss. Not your circumstances.
                You.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
                Taking ownership means accepting that your current situation is the result of your past decisions —
                and your future situation will be determined by what you choose to do now. Excuses feel good in the
                moment, but responsibility builds wealth.

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-heading font-bold mb-4 text-white">Long-Term Thinking</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
                The best financial decisions are boring. They compound slowly. They don't make good social media posts.
                But over time, they create wealth that lasts.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
                Short-term thinking destroys wealth faster than almost anything else. Long-term thinking requires
                patience, consistency, and the willingness to delay gratification. It's not exciting — but it works.

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-heading font-bold mb-4 text-white">Systems Over Goals</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Goals are targets. Systems are processes. Goals tell you where you want to go. Systems get you there.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-300">
                Most people focus on goals and ignore systems. But systems are what create sustainable results.
                A good system runs whether you're motivated or not. It compounds. It scales. It lasts.
